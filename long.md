This is a test of multi-word links.

Here is a [single word link][1] that should work as before.

Here is a [multi word link][2] that should now work correctly.

And here is a very [long link that should span multiple lines when rendered because it contains many words and will exceed the content width][3] to test wrapping.

Regular text can appear between links like [this multi word link][4] and [another one][5] here.
