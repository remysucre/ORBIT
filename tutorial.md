Welcome to the HYPERSPACE

Here's your cursor: 

Try cranking it!

Notice the little dot? That's the tail of the cursor, pointing AWAY from where you are headed. In other words, you will use the crank to steer.

Now hold the UP button to accelerate. You can push the top/bottom of the screen to scroll, and TELEPORT between the left/right border. 

You can get some good practice by playing HYPER METEOR - the game that inspired ORBIT's control mechanism.

You can also use DOWN to scroll, well, down, and LEFT to scroll back up, but that's much less exciting. Now try thrusting the cursor all the way down...
























Oh hello there. Did you think there's more to see? Well yes, what good is a browser without some [links][1]? Try clicking on it with the RIGHT button (it is a lot closer to UP than the A button which is why I chose it).

If you want to make web pages for ORBIT, I've put up a description of the format [here][2]. It's got a lot of external links that will only work in a grown-up browser, oh well. But you probably already know how to do it, because the format is pretty much just markdown (and actually way simpler).

Finally, ORBIT is still a baby (born on 2025/11/15), so it doesn't know how to do a lot of things. If you want to help out, make some PRs to the code at github.com/remysucre/ORBIT!
