Welcome to the HYPERSPACE!

Here's your cursor: 

Try cranking it!

Now hold the UP button to accelerate. You can push the top/bottom of the screen to scroll, and TELEPORT between the left/right border. 

You can also use DOWN to scroll, well, down, and LEFT to scroll back up, but that's much less exciting. Now try thrusting the cursor all the way down...
























Oh hello there! Did you think there's more to see? Well yes, what good is a browser without some [links][1]? Try clicking on it with the RIGHT button (which is a lot closer to UP than the A button).

If you want to make web pages for ORBIT, I've put up a description of the format [here][2]. It's got a lot of external links that will only work in a grown-up browser, oh well. But you probably already know how to do it, because the format is pretty much just markdown (and actually way simpler).

Finally, ORBIT is still a baby (born on 2025/11/15), so it doesn't know how to do a lot of things. If you want to help it out, make some PRs to the code (at https://github.com/remysucre/ORBIT)!
